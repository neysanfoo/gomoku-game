                    <h2>What is Gomoku?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gomoku, also known as Five in a Row, is a two-player
                        strategy game played on a 15x15 board.
                    </p>
                    <h2>How to play</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gomoku is a strategy game played on a grid. The goal is
                        to align five of your pieces horizontally, vertically,
                        or diagonally before your opponent.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Strategy</h2>
                    <p>
                        As with many strategy games, the key to winning Gomoku
                        is to balance your offensive and defensive moves. It's
                        important to watch your opponent's moves and try to
                        anticipate their next move, while also making sure to
                        protect your own pieces.
